              the original meanings embedded in traditional patterns. <br>
              It is also important to acknowledge that many of the artisans in Colombia are part of Indigenous
              groups, and therefore in talking about their objects this project is also talking about them.
              This opened interesting questions about data appropriation and the ethics of talking about vulnerable
              groups.

              <p>With the rapid increase in generative AI’s accuracy and capacity to blur the line between real
                and generated, this project delves into the encoding of cultural meaning within the context of
                artisan artefacts, specifically Colombian artefacts. What happens when a generative model is capable
                of understanding what the “Balay basketry” from the Cubeo artisans is and produces designs with
                the right colours and materials? Or, could weaving techniques be passed down to generations with
                the help of generative AI?
              </p>
              <p>Combined with the idea of awareness and education, ‘Artesan ia’ is intended to be an interactive
                experience in which people can learn about patterns that usually accompany Colombian artisan artefacts
                and question the role of generative AI in the context of cultural heritage objects. This project
                has three different elements intended to work in conjunction: a set of patterns displayed
                in cards, a box in which a computer vision model reads the patterns, and finally, a Processing sketch
                that reacts to each pattern.</p>

              <p>Artesan-ia has been inspired by different Interactive projects that seek to fuse
                cultural heritage knowledge with technology as a medium to explore concepts such as
                meaning, co-creation, and misrepresentation. In an attempt to dismantle the perception
                of apparent friction between what is ‘traditional’ and ‘technological’, Ars Electronica
                ran the Electronic Indigenous Art project in 2018. This project brought together indigenous
                and non-indigenous people to produce interactive creative work.</p>
              <p>One of the outcomes, ‘The Earth that is Us’ (Electronica, 2019), is a project that plays
                with the patterns and meaning of body painting for the Brazilian Karapotó Plak-ô Indigenous
                community. For this project, the community would first draw the patterns that would later
                be projected onto their bodies, and on those of the audience.

                between them. However, it also meant an understanding of how the Incas used the system, which also

            <p>As mentioned, ‘Artesan-ia’ was inspired by projects that fostered interactions in combination
              with the exploration and learning of cultural heritage content. The generated interaction involves
              a user, an input, and an output; and was very much influenced by the Yoto mini box, a product designed
              to play stories when a card is placed in the box. Each card triggers a story that is read out loud
              and which can be easily switched if the card is changed.</p>
            <p>Following this principle, I sketched an interaction that initially aimed to communicate the real
              meaning of a pattern, v.s the distorted notions they have acquired. To achieve this, I had sketched
              two different boxes, one ‘transparent box’ that would tell me the real meaning of a pattern v.s an
              ‘opaque box’ that would tell me the distorted notion of the pattern. However, the interaction was
              simplified into a single box that receives input from a card (the pattern) and outputs expanded
              information about that card. The development of this project is divided into the design of
              the box, the design of the Processing sketch and the cards, and finally the design of the interaction
              (all elements working together).</p>

            <h3>The box</h3>
            <p>As a result of reading about Artificial Intelligence and the ethical considerations behind it,
              I stumbled upon the concept of the Black Box models. These models are created from data, with
              minimum input from humans, and often produce results that are complex to explain and are often opaque
              (Rudin
              & Radin, 2019).
              However, I found it more relevant to focus on the counterpart of these obscure models, that is,
              Interpretable models.
              In the overall interactive experience, the box is the part that receives the pattern from the user and
              produces an output. The way I chose to represent an interpretable model is by literally building a box
              from
              which all the training of my model is happening. All the elements that go inside it (the camera and the
              cards with patterns) are visible to everyone.</p>

              <h3>First Iteration</h3>
              <p>The purpose of the flowchart is to understand the overall user journey and guide the code
                structure of the app.
                By identifying main screens and interactions, I was able to start thinking programmatically and roughly
                understand the components
                and the file structure that make up the app. This flow chart came in handy when I needed to create the
                routing of the app and the
                different navigations during the code development.</p>

              <p>The interaction of the Processing sketch relies on the X and Y positioning of an element

                to a specific X and Y position within the map, and trigger the opening of a new window. </p>
              <p>To achieve this, I created specific sections within the sketch that covered a range (red squares on the
                map).
                The elements that trigger the pop-up windows when entering a given range are the yellow butterflies,
                which move
                across the map according to the pattern the user enters in the box. I used yellow butterflies mainly
                because it
                is an important reference to Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez's magic realism and his book “One
                Hundred

              <p>As part of the interaction, I designed 5 different cards displaying patterns that covered the 5
                different
                regions in which Colombia
                is geographically divided. The main objective of selecting these specific patterns was to show the
                multiculturality of the country,
                as well as its richness in natural resources. Additionally, it is important to understand that the areas
                that artisans
                inhabit inform their use of materials,
                techniques, colours, and ultimately the artefact’s patterns.</p>

              <p>The purpose of the cards with patterns is to enable the interaction between the user and the Processing
                sketch.
                The interaction between the butterflies and the cards is managed through Wekinator, an open-source tool
                compatible with
                Processing that allows the training of neural networks for image recognition.</p>
              <p>Using this software, I mapped each pattern to a specific area in the map. This means that when the
                camera
                identifies certain colours and configurations in the image, the butterflies will move to the section
                assigned
                to that specific pattern. To test this principle, I sketched some quick patterns and ran a Processing
                sketch
                that reduced the camera input to 100 pixels. Reducing the number of pixels the camera needs to analyse
                helped
                the model training to be faster.</p>

          <h3>Cards</h3>
          <p>After mapping the patterns with their corresponding geographical area in the map of Colombia, I refined the
            design of the cards.
            The pattern would cover most of the space since the camera needs to interpret the image and trigger the
            interaction. At the top of the card,
            I added the name of the Artisan artefact, then I added information about the Region and location in which the
            artefacts are usually
            made and the name of the main community maker. When the card is inserted in the box, the user can still see
            the name of the artisan artefact,
            but the pattern will trigger a location change in the map, and show more information about the artefact.</p>

              <p>The project outcome is 'Artesan.ia', an Interaction that brings together encoding of meaning and
                computer vision to promote awareness and interest in artisan artefacts. The 'medium is the message'
                (McLuhan, 1995) and in this project, the medium is the computer vision model. It is the making of the
                model
                and its constraints that have informed the making of the project. The three stages of the process for
                this interaction are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Input:</strong> a card enters the box. </li>
                <li><strong>2. Training interface:</strong> the camera reads the image, and through Wekinator, a
                  position is mapped to
                  match the pattern with its
                  corresponding location. Then the model is trained to match different patterns to different locations.
                </li>
                <li><strong>3. Output: </strong>the Processing sketch reacts to the card inserted, primarily by changing
                  the position of
                  the butterflies in the map and opening information popups along the way.</li>

          <p>This project took me to different places. Starting with the encoding of meaning it turned into an
            understanding of
            the inside workings of Artificial Intelligence models. The role of machine learning is to process information,
            in this case,
            this information has cultural meaning to us, but in reality, the model can’t acknowledge its historical
            importance.
            We consciously grant meaning to that information and data.</p>
          <p>Finally, this project also attempts to inform people and create an interactive experience. If further
            developed, this project could be improved,
            starting with the actual training of the computer vision model. It could be enhanced to capture better details
            of the patterns and ‘resist’ changes in light.
            The flow between the elements could also be improved, with changes in the box's architecture, and the
            different screens' coding.</p>
