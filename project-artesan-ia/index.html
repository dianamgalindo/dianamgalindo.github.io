              the original meanings embedded in traditional patterns. <br>
              It is also important to acknowledge that many of the artisans in Colombia are part of Indigenous
              groups, and therefore in talking about their objects this project is also talking about them.
              This opened interesting questions about data appropriation and the ethics of talking about vulnerable
              groups.

              <p>With the rapid increase in generative AI’s accuracy and capacity to blur the line between real
                and generated, this project delves into the encoding of cultural meaning within the context of
                artisan artefacts, specifically Colombian artefacts. What happens when a generative model is capable
                of understanding what the “Balay basketry” from the Cubeo artisans is and produces designs with
                the right colours and materials? Or, could weaving techniques be passed down to generations with
                the help of generative AI?
              </p>
              <p>Combined with the idea of awareness and education, ‘Artesan ia’ is intended to be an interactive
                experience in which people can learn about patterns that usually accompany Colombian artisan artefacts
                and question the role of generative AI in the context of cultural heritage objects. This project
                has three different elements that are intended to work in conjunction: a set of patterns displayed
                in cards, a box in which a computer vision model reads the patterns, and finally, a Processing sketch
                that reacts to each pattern.</p>

              <p>Artesan-ia has been inspired by different Interactive projects that seek to fuse
                cultural heritage knowledge with technology as a medium to explore concepts such as
                meaning, co-creation, and misrepresentation. In an attempt to dismantle the perception
                of apparent friction between what is ‘traditional’ and ‘technological’, Ars Electronica
                ran the Electronic Indigenous Art project in 2018. This project brought together indigenous
                and non-indigenous people to produce interactive creative work.</p>
              <p>One of the outcomes, ‘The Earth that is Us’ (Electronica, 2019), is a project that plays
                with the patterns and meaning of body painting for the Brazilian Karapotó Plak-ô Indigenous
                community. For this project, the community would first draw the patterns that would later
                be projected onto their bodies, and on those of the audience.

              In her work Knots of Code, Paola explores the Quipu (a system of knotted tally cords used by the
              Inca Civilization to encode information) through computer vision. This work aimed to use technology
              to decode the possible meaning of the system by looking at the amount of knots, and the distance
              between them. However, it also meant an understanding of how the Incas used the system, which also
              implies the use of AI for archaeological research (Torres, 2020).</p>

            <p>As mentioned, ‘Artesan-ia’ was inspired by projects that fostered interactions in combination
              with the exploration and learning of cultural heritage content. The generated interaction involves
              a user, an input, and an output; and was very much influenced by the Yoto mini box, a product designed
              to play stories when a card is placed in the box. Each card triggers a story that is read out loud
              and which can be easily switched if the card is changed.</p>
            <p>Following this principle, I sketched an interaction that initially aimed to communicate the real
              meaning of a pattern, v.s the distorted notions they have acquired. To achieve this, I had sketched
              two different boxes, one ‘transparent box’ that would tell me the real meaning of a pattern v.s an
              ‘opaque box’ that would tell me the distorted notion of the pattern. However, the interaction was
              simplified into a single box that receives input from a card (the pattern) and outputs expanded
              information about that card. The development of this project is divided into the design of
              the box, the design of the Processing sketch and the cards, and finally the design of the interaction
              (all elements working together).</p>

          <h3>The box</h3>
          <p>As a result of reading about Artificial Intelligence and the ethical considerations behind it,
            I stumbled upon the concept of the Black Box models. These models are created from data, with
            minimum input from humans, and often produce results that are complex to explain and are often opaque (Rudin
            & Radin, 2019).
            However, I found it more relevant to focus on the counterpart of these obscure models, that is,
            Interpretable models.
            In the overall interactive experience, the box is the part that receives the pattern from the user and
            produces an output. The way I chose to represent an interpretable model is by literally building a box from
            which all the training of my model is happening. All the elements that go inside it (the camera and the
            cards with patterns) are visible to everyone.</p>
          <div class="">

              <h3>First Iteration</h3>
              <p>The purpose of the flowchart is to understand the overall user journey and guide the code
                structure of the app.
                By identifying main screens and interactions, I was able to start thinking programmatically and roughly
                understand the components
                and the file structure that make up the app. This flow chart came in handy when I needed to create the
                routing of the app and the
                different navigations during the code development.</p>

              <p>In the second iteration, I decided to add a pattern to the box. This design choice was initially
                aimed to help light come through the box, and therefore support the detection of the patterns by
                the camera. Later, it also became an analogy for the artisan artefacts I was researching.</p>

        <h3>Processing Sketch Design</h3>
        <p>Colombia is a multicultural country with more than 100 indigenous ethnic groups and about 65 different
          spoken native languages. Its geographical richness has allowed the country to be geographically divided
          into 6 distinct natural regions, each with its very distinctive climate, fauna and flora, customs, and
          people
          (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2015). </p>
        <div class="project_container">
          <div class="sub_container">

            <p>The Processing sketch intends to communicate the richness of the
              country and its makers. Based on the 5 mainland regions in which Colombia is divided, I identified and
              mapped
              the main artisan makers for each region and selected the ones that were better supported by veridic
              information.
              These communities were found through a collection of resources, such as books (Villegas & Jiménez, 2000)
              and online
              government archives (Artesanías de Colombia SIART, 2014).</p>

          <p>After selecting the maker communities I organised them into a chart, and then located them in the Colombian
            map. For each region,
            I chose representative fauna and flora, buildings, or industries, and kept the geographical division clear
            through the variation of
            colous and clear division lines.</p>

          <h3>Interactive elements</h3>
          <div class="project_container">
            <div>
              <p>The interaction of the Processing sketch relies on the X and Y positioning of an element reaching
                specific
                areas of the sketch.
                I used yellow butterflies to indicate movement within the map, mainly because the yellow butterfly is an
                important reference to
                Gabriel Garcia Marquez's magic realism and his book “One Hundred Years of Solitude”.</p>
              <p>When the butterflies reach a specific position, they seamlessly initiate the opening of an overlay
                window
                within the sketch.
                This window not only provides additional information about the introduced pattern in the box but also
                encourages the reader to
                contemplate the role of AI by showcasing AI-generated objects. Below, you'll find three examples of
                these
                overlay windows in
                action which talk about the Amazon, Andean, and Pacific regions.</p>

        <h3>The Pattern Cards</h3>
        <div class="project_container">
          <div class="sub_container">
            <p>As part of the interaction, I designed 5 different cards displaying patterns that covered the 5 different
              regions in which Colombia
              is geographically divided. The main objective of selecting these specific patterns was to show the
              multiculturality of the country,
              as well as its richness in natural sources. It is important to understand that the areas that artisans
              inhabit inform their use of materials,
              techniques, colours, and ultimately the artefact’s patterns.</p>

        <h3>Decoding the Pattern</h3>
        <p>The design of the cards was influenced by the
          dimensionality of the box, as well
          as the field of view of the camera. In the initial stage, I sketched some quick patterns and ran a
          Processing sketch that reduced the camera input to 100 pixels.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would like to mention that the selection of these patterns was intrinsically related to the
          design of the map in the Processing Sketch.
          The map was an informed process of selection, based on the amount of available resources that covered
          relevant information on the maker community and the patterns themselves</p>

              <p>The project outcome is 'Artesan.ia', an Interaction that brings together encoding of meaning and
                computer vision to promote awareness and interest in artisan artefacts. The 'medium is the message'
                (McLuhan, 1995) and in this project, the medium is the computer vision model. It is the making of the
                model
                and its constraints that have informed the making of the project. The three stages of the process for
                this interaction are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>1. Input: a card enters the box. </li>
                <li>2. Training interface: the camera reads the image, and through Wekinator, a position is mapped to
                  match the pattern with its
                  corresponding location. Then the model is trained to match different patterns to different locations.
                </li>
                <li>3. Output: the Processing sketch reacts to the card inserted, primarily by changing the position of
                  the butterflies in the map and opening information popups along the way.</li>

        <p>This project took me to different places. Starting with the encoding of meaning it turned into an
          understanding of
          the inside workings of Artificial Intelligence models. The role of machine learning is to process information,
          in this case,
          this information has cultural meaning to us, but in reality, the model can’t acknowledge its historical
          importance.
          We consciously grant meaning to that information and data.</p>
        <p>Finally, this project also attempts to inform people and create an interactive experience. If further
          developed, this project could be improved,
          starting with the actual training of the computer vision model. It could be enhanced to capture better details
          of the patterns and ‘resist’ changes in light.
          The flow between the elements could also be improved, with changes in the box's architecture, and the
          different screens' coding.</p>
