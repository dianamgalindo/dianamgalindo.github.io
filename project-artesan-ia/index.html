            </div>
            <p>Despite various government commitments, 53 million metric tonnes
              of waste are predicted to enter our aquatic ecosystems by 2030 (Borrelle et al., 2020).
              Therefore, it is imperative to understand the threats that pollution poses to marine and coastal
              ecosystems, as well as to our own health.
            </p>
            <p>By enhancing the current marine litter monitoring programmes’ methodologies and
              understanding the value of data collection on waste, Debris
              Lore aims to support the efficient and effective collection of this data. This data can later be used to
              inform policies, legislation, and
              the development of sustainability action plans.</p>

            <h3>Plástico Precioso Uramba | Citizen science project in Colombia</h3>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Precious Plastic is a worldwide open-source project that empowers local small-scale
              recycling communities. The aim is to re-purpose plastic that would otherwise go to landfill, or worse,
              to the ocean. Plástico Precioso Uramba, Colombia, adopts
              this model and augments it through citizen science research, in which volunteers, local and non-locals,
              come together to clean the beaches, learn about plastics, and transform the material. I took part in one
              of
              their annual workshops, where we went to the beach to collect different types of plastics that
              we would later convert into new material.</p>
            <p>Their fantastic team were key in understanding the viability
              of a tool like Debris Lore. In a remote area such as Bahía Málaga, issues like accessibility to technology
              and Internet networks are a reality. Yet, the community and volunteers manage to collect valuable data
              whilst
              fostering a deeper sense of responsibility towards waste. Therefore, Debris Lore is born to support those
              existing citizen-led projects and seeks to increase their impact through their own data.

            <h3>Exploring different technologies and narratives</h3>
            <p>The development of the app started with the idea of using AR (Augmented Reality) or MR
              (Mixed Reality)
              technologies to offer the user a hands-free experience. After going through a beach cleanup myself, it was
              clear that the use of the hands was key to collect waste. I explored the possibility of using the
              Microsoft
              HoloLens to implement an information overlay that allowed the localization and classification of plastic
              by types.</p>

              By identifying main screens and interactions, I was able to start thinking programmatically and roughly

          litter monitoring powered by volunteers.
          The next steps for this project to be further developed involve the creation of a more robust user journey,
          including improving the detection model
          accuracy and building a database where key data can be stored. User testing would also be a key stage for the

        <p>Finally, this project has been a great experience to learn about project management techniques,
          prioritization and agile methodology.
          It also helped me to expand my knowledge in app development, machine learning, computer vision, and
          user-centered design.</p>
