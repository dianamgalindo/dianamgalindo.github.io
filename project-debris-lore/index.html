            <p class="textbg">Debris Lore is a smartphone app that uses machine learning
              and computer vision technologies to register and document the quantity and
              types of rubbish found on beaches. This app runs an object detection model
              using smartphone hardware to assist researchers and volunteers in classifying
              different types of waste during beach cleanup campaigns in citizen
              science-led projects.</p>

              <span class="variant3">&nbsp;</span>
            </div>
            <p class="black">Despite various government commitments, 53 million metric tonnes
              of waste are predicted to enter our aquatic ecosystems by 2030 (Borrelle et al., 2020).
              Therefore, it is imperative to understand the threats that pollution poses to marine and coastal
              ecosystems, as well as to our own health.
            </p>
            <p class="black">By enhancing the current marine litter monitoring programmes’ methodologies and
              understanding the value of data collection on waste, Debris
              Lore aims to support the efficient and effective collection of this data. This data can later be used to
              inform policies, legislation, and
              the development of sustainability action plans.</p>

          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="black">Precious Plastic is a worldwide open-source project that empowers local small-scale
              recycling communities. The aim is to re-purpose plastic that would otherwise go to landfill, or worse,
              to the ocean. Plástico Precioso Uramba, Colombia, adopts
              this model and augments it through citizen science research, in which volunteers, local and non-locals,
              come together to clean the beaches, learn about plastics, and transform the material. I took part in one
              of
              their annual workshops, where we went to the beach to collect different types of plastics that
              we would later convert into new material.</p>
            <p class="black">Their fantastic team were key in understanding the viability
              of a tool like Debris Lore. In a remote area such as Bahía Málaga, issues like accessibility to technology
              and Internet networks are a reality. Yet, the community and volunteers manage to collect valuable data
              whilst
              fostering a deeper sense of responsibility towards waste. Therefore, Debris Lore is born to support those
              existing citizen-led projects and seeks to increase their impact through their own data.

              <p class="margin-bottom black">Whilst technology has been advancing to support scientists and researchers
                in
                collecting valid data on
                waste,
                it has mainly remained in technical hands. Recently, mobile apps have been developed to explore the
                power of
                collecting data through volunteer efforts, minimising the gap between technical and non-technical users.
                However,
                these apps rely on lengthy category lists and input boxes, making them inevitably prone to human error
                when
                classifying
                different types of waste.</p>

              (Mixed Reality)
              technologies to offer the user a hands-free experience. After going through a beach cleanup myself, it was
              clear that the use of the hands was key to collect waste. I explored the possibility of using the
              Microsoft
              HoloLens to implement an information overlay that allowed the localization and classification of plastic
              by types.</p>
            <p class="black margin-bottom">However due to constraints in the headset itself, and its low price
              accessibility, I started to design for smartphone hardware. </p>

            resources (mainly digital surveys).
            This project has identified two user groups: Citizen Volunteers (Kate) and Researchers (Dani), both

              structure of the app.
              By identifying main screens and interactions, I was able to start thinking programmatically and roughly
              understand the components
              and the file structure that make up the app. This flow chart came in handy when I needed to create the
              routing of the app and the

          <p class="black">Making use of the brand guidelines, the app demonstrates uniformity across its different
            screens. CTA’s use a clear style and provide enough space to be clickable,
            while input forms across screens also present a uniform style. Defining these visual elements was key to
            identifying components that repeat, such as fonts, colours,
            spacing, etc; allowing the creation of a Global styling file in React Native. This is very powerful because
            it enables the styling of components present in different
            screens using a single styling constant.</p>

          <p class="black">The app’s most important screens are the ‘Start survey’ and ‘Live survey’. These two
            interactions carry the main functionality of the app, which is to collect
            the details of a beach cleanup and then open the phone’s camera which will run an object recognition model
            on the images it captures. The ‘Start survey’ screen
            presents the user with a form that needs to be completed before starting a session, replacing the use of the
            traditional physical data card. After completing this,
            the user will be requested to grant access to the camera, and the ‘Live Survey’ screen will come up. In this
            screen, the user is presented with a live view of their
            surroundings, a button to capture images, and a brief of the elements they have found.</p>

            Offering a wider view of

            process
            of a user opening
            the camera(1), triggering the object detection model(2) which will then process each frame from the
            camera(3).
            The frames then
            go through the object detection model(4), and the user finally gets some visual feedback (UI) such as the
            number and kind of
            elements found(5). This process can be repeated and finishes when the user presses the ‘Finish Survey’
            button,
            which will log all
            the findings of the session.</p>

            These models were trained on a dataset I manually labelled, including the bounding boxes, focusing on two
            classes: 'Plastic Bottle' and 'Cardboard'.
            After training the model on different steps and batch sizes, I stayed with a version trained on 15,000
            steps,
            which seemed to get a good percentage of
            accurate predictions. However, to improve the model’s confidence there’s still some more training and
            fine-tuning left to do.</p>
