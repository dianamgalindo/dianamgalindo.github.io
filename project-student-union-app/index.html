            <p class="textbg white-text">The following project explores the development of a mobile app for the Arts Student Union.
               Starting from the concept of ‘community as sentiment’ (Simpson, 1937) rather than merely ‘locality’ (Clark, 1973),
               the application brings together a community that can live online and offline. The application pretends to meet the 
               innate human need for belonging and significance, allowing students to connect with each other through communities 
               where they share interests. <br>
               This app caters to two main users: The student who wants to be part of a community (either a society or sports club), 
               and the student committee member, who is responsible for running a community within the Student Union.

            <div class="sub_container">
              <p>During the process of creating the Computer Science Society at the University of Arts London, our committee realised
                 how broad and disjointed the sports clubs and Societies felt in the online realm. Every society seemed to have its own 
                 Instagram account, and other communication channels, while the process of managing a society felt daunting, with different 
                 forms that needed to be completed and sent over email, such as budget Excel documents, health and safety word documents, 
                 training sessions, etc. 
              </p>
              <p>Therefore, the aim of creating the Student Union app is to house all these different areas under a unified platform, 
                allowing the creation and management of societies, as well as facilitating communication with members. This app is 
                therefore built as a platform where UAl students can find out all about the communities they can be part of, create 
                and manage their own, and speed up communication and procedures with the Student Union.</p>

            <div class="sub_container">
              <p>The main brief for the App development unit gravitated around the creation of an app aimed 
                at a particular community, whilst being critical of the concept of community. We were also 
                prompted to focus on researching the needs and habits of the chosen community, as well as design,
                 prototype and iterate. I explored different app ideas, ranging from an app for parents who can’t 
                 afford childcare, to an app that helps people meet new individuals over coffee. </p>
              <p>In the end, I chose to talk about students, and the student union, since I was going through the 
                process of opening a new society along with the committee members. Additionally, I was part of the 
                volleyball society, which operated under a separate app dedicated only to sports, making me realise 
                how disjointed the communication channels and management of societies and sports clubs were.

              <h3>Competitor Research</h3>
              <p>Looking at other existing apps created to manage societies was incredibly useful for understanding the main features available in the market and the design elements that each one of 
                them brings to the table. I researched the ‘Society’, ‘Edunity’, ‘Huzzle’, and ‘Sums’ apps, extracting the main features for each, their availability on app stores, examples of their 
                interfaces, and their differentiation propositions. To summarise this detailed research, I created a table that compares the main features across these apps. </p>

          <div class="project_container margin-bottom-internal">
            <div class="sub_container">
              <p>How can my app differentiate from the competitors? From the research, I was able to identify ‘must-have’ features for societies and sports club apps. Many of them focus on engagement, 
                events management, and in-app ticket purchases. While some apps exploit the reach that social media offers, some others consider them noise and a distraction to the user. There’s also 
                the idea of monetisation of ads to bring in funds from sponsors, and a real concern to communicate the app’s commitment with GDPR and privacy.</p>
              <p>There are opportunities to improve the management of the communities and improve the communication between Student Union and Societies/ Sports clubs, which have been summarised in the following mind map:</p>

          <div>
            <p>to be able to come up with a look and feel (brand guidelines) for the app, I explored the SU communication 
              channels, such as their Instagram and website. From this observation, I was able to extract logos, fonts, 
              colours, and other design elements that contribute to brand consistency. However, I also explored other app’s 
              information layouts, buttons, use of colour and use of imagery, as possible inspiration.</p>

              later in the development process. These guidelines were key to generating visual cohesion and coherence on every screen of the app.</p>

            of the app. These prototypes were key to understanding the different functionalities that needed to be coded in SwiftUI, and how I could make 
            certain components modular in the coding process. The High-fidelity prototype also focuses on making a clear distinction in the user journey 
            between those students who manage a society (committee members) versus those students who are only members.</p>

                  <li>The ‘my basket’ section was initially designed as a place to host tickets that were not purchased on the spot, suggest events that might be relevant to the user, and allow user checkout. 
                    Later, this screen changed to show the already purchased tickets, making it easier for user to show their tickets at events.</li>
                  <li>The first screen was inspired by Amazon’s checkout page, whilst the second screen was inspired by  Eventbrite, which brings out the real purpose of the tickets feature.</li>

                <p>The checkout process was moved from the main Ticket screen, where the main purpose is to find purchased tickets. Instead, the checkout process is active when the user is seeking to buy 
                  tickets, and it will allow them to select the type of tickets, the quantity, and then pay.</p>

                   a potential risk, as users may inadvertently log out while attempting to access their ID. This is precisely why the decision was made to position the logout button at the bottom

                <p>The selection of icons was rather complex, especially when trying to make clear that the committee member had extra functionality within the app. I have used SF icons, which are premade by Apple. 
                  The icon for communities changed to interconnected circles to represent unity, and the admin icon changed to a more standardized icon that is used to communicate existing 'edit' abilities</p>

            <p>Keeping in line with the brand guidelines that were previously defined, I used the main colours to communicate uniformity between buttons that perform an action. The headers are also uniform and communicate their intention clearly. 
              The main purpose is to allow the user to understand easily where things can be clicked.</p>

              <p>The outcome of this project is an app developed on SwiftUI, written on Swift and coded specifically 
                for IOS devices. The main purpose of this app is to facilitate the management of student societies and 
                sports clubs, as well as engage and connect members and committees under a unique platform.</p>
             <p>The app counts with key sections such as in-app ticket purchases, messaging capabilities, society profile 
              and live updates, digital student ID, and an admin dashboard dedicated for those committee members who need
               to manage their societies. Being a committee member unlocks features such as completing training modules,
                creating new events, completing health and safety forms, and providing live updates to society members.</p>

          <p>This project allowed me to develop an end-to-end product, placing emphasis on the user, and implementing
             ideation and iteration design techniques. On the journey, I also developed an understanding of the SwiftUI
              coding platform and explored the opportunity to work with an existing body of data owned by the Student 
              Union and UAL. There are still back-end processes that need consideration, such as login validations,
              student ID, and admin permissions.</p>
