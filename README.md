# Personal Portfolio
## Motivation 
This project is intended to demonstrate a series of fundamental concepts of web design and development through the coding of my Personal Portfolio. 
I have created a series of pages that act as a starting point for the website that will host my work. The project has been built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Structure
This website is aimed to host different sections that talk about some of my past projects. I must make clear that not all the pages have been built. To start with, I have built the homepage, which will host the 'About me section', the Projects page, and an example of how a single project would look like.<br/>
**Therefore the journey could be defined as**: Homepage -> Projects -> Home Salon Project (Sample page)
### Portfolio Structure
- **[Homepage](https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~digalin/Portfolio/)**
- **[About me](https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~digalin/Portfolio/index.html#about_me)**
- **[Projects](https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~digalin/Portfolio/Projects/portfolio_projects.html)** 
    - **[Home Salon Project](https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~digalin/WK03/index-wk03.html)** 
- **[Lab](#)** - Coming Soon
- **[Contact](#)** - Coming Soon

### Responsive
The website is responsive with breakpoint at 390px (mobile devices), 768px (Tablet devices), 992px, 1200px and 1400px (Large screens).

## Accessibility and Environmental considerations (Sustainable web design) 
- The website has been tested for **keyboard accessibility**, where all links are accessible.
- The website uses a **dark palette** for energy efficiency when displaying it, which also takes into consideration the contrast of the distinct elements. [Reference](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/dark-colour-web-design/)
- For the time being, the website only uses **system fonts** to reduce loading times.
- Where necessary images have been **labeled meaningfully** for screen readers.
- The experience of navigating the website has been designed to work across different devices.

### External libraries
The website also contains links to external libraries, primarily Bootstrap and JQuery.

### Atributions to external resources
- **[Sustainable web design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/)** - This has been a great resource and source of inspiration to follow practices that not only advocate for accessibility but also for responsible and sustainable web design. <br/>

Resources such as icons have been referenced in the following document: [Attributions](https://git.arts.ac.uk/17518357/CodingThree/blob/main/CodingThree_DevWork/public_html/images/Attributions.txt). <br>
Code resources have been referenced within the code, in the section they have been used for.

## Improvements
The potfolio needs to be populated with real content. It is my goal to make it fully functional and follow a smooth user journey that takes the user through the page easily and effectively.
I would also like to implement an **'Accessibility' menu**, where I can offer my user the possibility to choose
between light/ dark mode, and a simpler render of the page (for sustainable purposes).
